## Projects

### Pharmaceutical Company Management App
*React Native • Node.js • MongoDB*

A comprehensive management system I built for pharmaceutical companies with role-based access for different team members - from CEOs to medical representatives. Handles everything from medicine inventory to sales tracking.

**Key features:**
- 9 different user roles with specific permissions
- Medicine database management
- Sales and distribution tracking
- Real-time dashboard for each role

**Why I built this:** Saw the complexity in pharma operations and wanted to create something that actually simplifies their daily workflow.

### White Beat AI Platform
*React • Django • OpenAI API*

An AI-powered platform that leverages OpenAI's capabilities to provide intelligent responses and automation. Built separate dashboards for users and admins.

**What it does:**
- Integrates OpenAI for smart responses
- User dashboard for interactions
- Admin panel for monitoring and management
- Clean, responsive interface

**Learning:** This project taught me a lot about API integration and handling async operations efficiently.

---

### E-Commerce Platform
*React • Django REST • MongoDB*

Full-featured online store with everything you'd expect - product browsing, cart, checkout, and an admin panel for managing inventory.

**Features:**
- Product catalog with search and filters
- Shopping cart and checkout flow
- Payment integration
- Admin dashboard for inventory management
- Responsive design with smooth animations

**Challenge:** Getting the cart state management right across the app was tricky but rewarding.

---

### User Management System
*Node.js • Express • MongoDB • React*

Built this as part of an internship assessment. It's a complete user management solution with authentication and role-based permissions.

**Includes:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User analytics and reporting
- Secure backend with proper validation

**What I learned:** Security best practices and proper API design patterns.
