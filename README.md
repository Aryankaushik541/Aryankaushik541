## 🚀 Projects I've Built

### 💊 Pharmaceutical Management System
**React Native • Node.js • MongoDB**

A complete management solution for pharmaceutical companies that I developed to streamline their operations. The system handles multiple user roles from executives to field representatives.

**What it includes:**
- Multi-role authentication system (9 different roles)
- Medicine inventory and tracking
- Sales distribution management
- Role-specific dashboards with relevant data
- Real-time updates and notifications

**The challenge:** Designing a permission system that's both secure and flexible enough for different organizational structures. Spent considerable time understanding actual pharma workflows before building.

### 🤖 White Beat AI Platform
**React • Django • OpenAI API**

An AI-powered platform that integrates OpenAI's capabilities to provide intelligent automation and responses. Built with separate interfaces for end users and administrators.

**Features:**
- OpenAI API integration for smart responses
- User dashboard for interactions and history
- Admin panel for monitoring and configuration
- Responsive design that works across devices

**What I learned:** Working with AI APIs taught me a lot about handling asynchronous operations, managing API costs, and designing fallback mechanisms for when things don't go as planned.

### 🛒 Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform
**React • Django REST Framework • MongoDB**

A complete online shopping solution with everything from product browsing to checkout. Built both the customer-facing store and the admin panel for managing inventory.

**Key features:**
- Product catalog with search and filtering
- Shopping cart with persistent state
- Secure checkout and payment integration
- Admin dashboard for inventory management
- Order tracking and management
- Responsive design with smooth animations

**Interesting part:** Implementing the cart state management across the app was tricky. Ended up using Context API with localStorage for persistence, which works really well.

### 👥 User Management System
**Node.js • Express • MongoDB • React**

Built this as part of an internship assessment at PurpleMerit. It's a comprehensive user management solution with proper authentication and role-based access control.

**Includes:**
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User analytics and reporting
- Secure backend with input validation
- Clean, intuitive admin interface

**Takeaway:** This project really solidified my understanding of security best practices, proper API design, and the importance of input validation at every level.

## 💡 A Bit More About Me

Started coding during college and quickly realized I enjoyed building things more than just learning theory. Most of what I know comes from building actual projects and solving real problems along the way.

I prefer working on projects that have a clear purpose - whether it's making someone's workflow easier or solving a specific problem. The pharmaceutical system, for example, came from understanding the complexity of medical operations and wanting to simplify it.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading about new tech, exploring different frameworks, or thinking about the next project to build.
